This VM is already set up with Binjitsu, and ready for you to play around with.

- This VM will self-destruct in 30 minutes.
- Be nice.  Everybody shares 1 CPU and 512MB of RAM.
- Don't be evil.

This is running in tmux, which misbehaves a bit in the browser.  
The meta key is Ctrl+B.

- New window: Meta-"c"
- Vertical split: Meta-"|"
- Horizontal split: Meta-"-"
- Next pane: Meta-"n"

The Python REPL is actually ipython.  This means that you can do tab-completion to
look up properties on an object and get help automatically.

For example, try "r.<tab>" or "r?<enter>" or "r.recvline?<enter>".

Have fun! -ebeip90
